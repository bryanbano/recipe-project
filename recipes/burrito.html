        <li>1 cup chopped romaine lettuce, or to taste</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup salsa, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in diced tomatoes with chile peppers. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>While rice is cooking, mix cumin, turmeric, basil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and seasoned salt together in a large bowl. Add olive oil. Toss potatoes in the mixture until well coated. Lay potatoes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until fork-tender, 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the size of the cubes, checking halfway through cooking time and flipping over as needed.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are cooking, heat a skillet over medium heat. Saute bell pepper and onion in the hot pan until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat black beans in a saucepan over medium-low heat until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Keep warm.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat tortillas in a separate skillet over low heat until warm, 1 to 2 minutes, or according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>Lay out tortillas and fill as desired with cooked rice, beans, potatoes, pepper-onion mixture, spinach, romaine lettuce, and salsa as desired. Wrap up into burritos and serve.</li>
